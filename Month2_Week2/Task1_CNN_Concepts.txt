1: What are the advantages of convolutional layers over fully connected layers in image processing tasks?

Convolutional layers exploit spatial locality: they focus on local regions of the image rather than connecting every pixel to every neuron.

They require fewer parameters compared to fully connected layers, reducing overfitting.

They are translation-invariant (detect patterns regardless of where they appear in the image).

Enable hierarchical feature learning (edges → textures → objects).

Q2: How does pooling help in reducing the computational complexity of a CNN?

Pooling layers downsample feature maps by summarizing regions (e.g., taking max/average).

This reduces the spatial dimensions of the data, which cuts down:

the number of parameters,

memory usage, and

computation in subsequent layers.

Pooling also provides a form of translation invariance, making the model less sensitive to small shifts.

Q3: Compare different types of pooling layers (max pooling, average pooling). What are their respective advantages and disadvantages?

Max Pooling

Takes the maximum value in each region.

Preserves sharp, prominent features (like edges).

Advantage: keeps strongest activations → good for classification.

Disadvantage: may lose contextual/average information.

Average Pooling

Takes the mean of values in each region.

Provides a smoother, generalized feature map.

Advantage: captures overall statistics.

Disadvantage: may dilute strong features → less effective for tasks needing sharp detection.
